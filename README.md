# MyWayToGolang
Here I will record my small exercises while learning Go. Why not making it public?
Below I will list everything I do and what I learned/was cool to me.

## 1. SumNumbersWithCalcHistory

Small calculator that sums up 2 numbers and register them in a history that can be requested at anytime or at the end of the program.

- Throwback to C/C++ with little pointer operations (Scanf, custom parser that return an integer or a string ptr error)
- After reading some theory of slices and how they work under the hood I implemented a history of my sums operations
- Goofed around the go libraries, I was able to convert string to Numbers, trim strings and add an element at index 0 with the slices package util!
- for loops ranges, for based on a boolean (a while but not a while lol) and some other basic things
